  echo "pmset displaysleepnow"
  pmset displaysleepnow

  # This can fail with error: "pmset: Failed to put the display to sleep, error 1006"
  # and I haven't been able to find a fix for it (March 25, 2022), the closest I found
  # was:
  #
  #     $ osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to sleep'
  #
  # but it puts the whole computer to sleep, not just the monitor. I looked up system
  # events and there didn't seem to be any displaysleep event.(found how to browse
  # the events from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40456065/where-can-i-find-documentation-for-system-events#comment98874279_40456562)
