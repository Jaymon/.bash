# .bash

Handy bash shell aliases and functions that I've written/collected over the years

# To Install

Just clone this repository into some directory, and then source it in your `.bash_aliases` or `.bash_profile` file

    . /path/to/repo/all.sh

If you only want specific file, say just the utility functions:

    . /path/to/repo/util.sh

That's it! Once you have it installed and sourced, you can see all the new commands you have at any time by running:

    ?

That should print out a helpful menu of all the commands available (this only works if you sourced `all.sh`).
