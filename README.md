# .bash

Handy bash shell aliases and functions that I've written/collected over the years

# To Install

Just clone this repository into some directory, and then source it in your .bash_aliases or .bash_profile file

    . /path/to/repo/all.sh

If you only want specific file, say just the utility functions:

    . /path/to/repo/util.sh

That's it.
